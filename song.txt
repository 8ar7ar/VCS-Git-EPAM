[Intro: Lana Del Rey]
Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things

[Verse 1: Barrie James O'Neill]
I walked in town on silver spurs that jingled to
A song that I had only sang to just a few
She saw my silver spurs and said lets pass some time
And I will give to you summer wine
Oh, Summer wine

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
Mm, Summer wine

[Verse 2: Barrie James O'Neill]
My eyes grew heavy and my lips, they could not speak
I tried to get up but I couldn't find my feet
She reassured me with an unfamiliar line
And then she gave to me more summer wine
Mm, Summer wine

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
Mm, Summer wine

[Verse 3: Barrie James O'Neill & Lana Del Rey]
When I woke up, the sun was shining in my eyes (in my eyes)
My silver spurs were gone, my head felt twice its size(in my eyes, uh)
She took my silver spurs, a dollar and a dime(Uh, Uh)
And left me cravin' for more summer wine
Oh, uh, Summer wine

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey & Barrie James O'Neill]
Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
Mm, Summer wine
Mm, Summer wine
Mm, Summer wine

[Outro: Lana Del Rey]
Ta ta da, ta da ta ta
Tu tu tu du, tu da
Tu tu tu da, tu da
Ah, ah
